* Introduction
  EmulArd is an Arduino testing framework based on providing a fake
  Arduino.h with common Arduino functions.

  This framework will also allow for creating networks of fake
  Arduinos.

  Here's a video of a network of fake Arduinos running a ring orientation algorithm. Each Arduino tries to figure out which neighbours are to the "left" and "right" consistently. The colour is the orientation, and the edges are the connections between the digital pins on the Arduino (red edges are HIGH, black edges are LOW):

  And here is a video of the same algorithm running on a bunch of Ardweenys (small Arduinos). The red LEDs represent their current orientation:
