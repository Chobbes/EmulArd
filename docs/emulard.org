* Arduino Program Clients
  Each Arduino program acts as a client to a server which actually
  pretends to be an Arduino. The program written for the Arduino
  actually communicates with the server via a protocol over stdin and
  stdout in order to set pin values and talk over serial to a virtual
  Arduino.
** Protocol
*** Serial Begin
    : SERIAL_BEGIN <unsigned long>
